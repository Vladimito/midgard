        <h2>I'm Vlad and this is my digital garden</h2>

        <p>This is going to be where I'll be sowing seeds about things in my life I find interesting and the various projects I'm working on.</p>

        <p>This site also is built using the Astro tutorial so it'll change and grow as I go along the guide. So do check back to see progress on its development.</p>

        <p>While I have you here, here's some info about me:
            <ul>
                <li>I'm a {identity.occupation} from {identity.country}. I finished my degree recently and I'm waiting on my paper in the mail!</li>
                {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
                <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
