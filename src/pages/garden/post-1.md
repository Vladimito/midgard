# Finally got myself to work on my digital garden

posted on: 2023-01-17

Welcome to new and _improved_ V's Domain. Now it's a garden where I can finally contain everything I want to talk about without annoying every last person on the planet about my interests. Now people can just subject themselves to it of their own **choice!**

## Patting myself on the back

I've:
1. Installed astro and got it working on this project
2. Actually making active progress on development of the site
3. And I've learnt how to make posts to it like the one you're seeing now

(This is still based off the astro tutorial which is _really_ helpful. Honestly I was so lost with the making part of the site that I couldn't focus on what I should have been learning. )
